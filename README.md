# Case-Study-03-Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction

In this case study, we use the **Credit Card Approval Data Set** from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) to build a machine learning classification model that predicts if the credit card application of an applicant will be accepted, based on several key factors available in the data set. We use `Logistic Regression` algorithm of `Sklearn` to perform the classification. More details are available in the Jupyter notebook.
